### Why build this independent blog

- Experience summary, learning note taking, problem analysis and solution process recording.
- Sort out ideas, sort out logic, improve document writing ability and language expression ability.
- Share and harvest happiness. With the help of other blog articles, I hope my notes can help others.
- To deepen the understanding of technical knowledge, even if you have seen other people's analysis, you need to understand it yourself and express it in language.
- To build a personal brand, everyone has their own brand. Whether it's job hunting or making friends, the original blog is a good personal card.
- Make like- minded industry friends, exchange and learn from each other.
- Pure function, strong customizability, no advertising, content audit and so on.
- Typesetting is simple. It is written in markdown language. Writing is typesetting. You can focus more on the content itself.
- Articles may not be updated frequently, but each one is carefully written.
- Remind yourself not to forget the original intention. When you don't want to write a blog, look at this article again, hoping to remember the significance of opening this blog.
